The Set game developed in Java integrates client-side and server-side components seamlessly. The client-side application features a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) that visually represents game elements such as cards and user interactions, ensuring an intuitive and engaging gameplay experience. On the server side, robust game logic manages card generation, set validation, scoring, and overall game state, facilitating real-time communication and synchronization between connected clients. Utilizing multithreading, the system efficiently handles concurrent player interactions without compromising performance, enhancing scalability and responsiveness during multiplayer sessions. This project highlights adept Java programming skills and a structured approach to implementing client-server architecture for interactive gaming environments.

To run the game, enter the following command in the terminal: java -cp target/classes bguspl.set.Main.
